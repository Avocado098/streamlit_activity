### ðŸš¨ Top Performers

- **ðŸ”Œ Lightning Charger** â€“ Leading the pack. It's clear that people are amazed by the lighting of the charger.
- **âš¡ USB-C Charging Cable** â€“ Affordable, essential, and always in demand. Over **3,500 units** sold.
- **ðŸ”‹ AAA Batteries (4-pack)** â€“ Who knew batteries would be this competitive?

### ðŸ“‰ Lowest Performers

- **ðŸš¿ LG Washing Machine** and **ðŸ”¥ LG Dryer** struggled to make an impact â€” big ticket items, but low traction.
- Could it be the price? Or are customers shopping elsewhere for home appliances? Either way, these two missed the mark.           

### ðŸ¤¯ Surprise Twist

- **iPhones and MacBooks?** Not the top sellers! While still valuable, theyâ€™re outpaced by everyday essentials.

### ðŸ’¡ What This Tells Us

- Sometimes, itâ€™s the small stuff that makes a big impact. Low-cost, high-usage products dominate the charts â€” and drive consistent sales.
